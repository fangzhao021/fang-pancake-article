      <h2>Method</h2>
      <p>Perk up boxed pancake mix by adding a dash of <strong>baking soda, lemon juice, vanilla and sugar</strong>. For maple flavor, add a small splash of maple syrup to the pancake batter. For a sweet-and-spicy touch, sprinkle some vanilla and cinnamon into the batter.</p>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ul class="list-inline">
        <li>Whisk the eggs and milk together to combine. Add in the flour, and beat until the batter is smooth and lump free. Add in any option add-ins you like here.</li>
        <li>Heat a nonstick pan over low-medium heat with cooking oil spray. Wipe over excess; pour about 1/3 cup of batter per pancake. Cook pancakes for 1 to 2 minutes, or until bubbles appear on the surface and the bases are golden brown. Flip and cook until golden; transfer to a warmed plate; repeat with remaining batter (spraying/greasing pan between ever second or third pancake if needed).</li>  
        <li>Serve immediately with yoghurt, ice cream, whipped cream, maple syrup, berries, or any other toppings you like.</li>
      </ul>
